# clang-tidy ledger — emeraude-base

> Owner decision 2026-09-30, plan Ave Robustus § 3 (projet-alpha `docs/plans/ave-robustus.md`). The configuration is
> this repository's `.clang-tidy`. Gate on every change: ZERO NEW finding on the touched translation units; a finding

## How to run

**Version: clang-tidy 21.1.6** (owner decision 2026-09-30). clang-tidy 19 (Debian's) SEGFAULTS in
`modernize-use-designated-initializers` on engine `src/CoreTypes.hpp` (`EngineContext`: a reference member
brace-initialised with a forward-declared type) — 8 of the 12 Console TUs, most of the engine. 21 does not crash.
Without sudo, from PyPI (the official LLVM binaries) in a scratch virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv <scratch>/ctvenv && <scratch>/ctvenv/bin/pip install "clang-tidy==21.1.6"
# One translation unit, with the compile database of a Claude build directory (never cmake-build-*) — cleaned of the
# GCC-only flags (-flto*, -fno-fat-lto-objects, -fuse-linker*) and with clang++ as the driver:
<scratch>/ctvenv/bin/clang-tidy -p <cleaned db dir> --quiet <file.cpp> > tidy.log 2>&1; echo EXIT=$?
```

Redirect, never pipe. Count the findings by check (`[check-name]` at the end of each warning line), keeping only
those whose file is inside the module (the header filter also reports every included header).

## Last full run per module

| Module | Date | Findings by check | Notes |

## Findings kept ON PURPOSE

Each with its file:line, its check and the reason (an owner decision).

_None recorded yet._
